# ProSBC1 Hardcoded Mapping Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The hardcoded config mapping logic was not working because the instance ID comparison was case-sensitive. The code was checking for `'ProSBC1'` (with capital letters), but the actual instance ID being used is `'prosbc1'` (all lowercase).

## Root Cause
```javascript
// OLD CODE (not working)
if (this.instanceId === 'ProSBC1') {
  // This condition was never true because instanceId is 'prosbc1'
}
```

## Solution Applied
Updated all instance ID comparisons to be case-insensitive:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (working)
if (this.instanceId && this.instanceId.toLowerCase() === 'prosbc1') {
  // This condition now works correctly
}
```

## Methods Fixed
1. **getConfigName()** - Now uses hardcoded mappings for ProSBC1
2. **resolveProsbc1Config()** - Fixed instance ID check
3. **getNumericConfigId()** - Now uses hardcoded mappings for ProSBC1
4. **ensureConfigSelected()** - Now uses hardcoded mappings for ProSBC1
5. **listDfFiles()** - Fixed instance ID check for ProSBC1 logic
6. **listDmFiles()** - Fixed instance ID check for ProSBC1 logic
7. **debugProSBC1Configuration()** - Fixed instance ID check
8. **updateFileRestAPI()** - Fixed database ID search logic for ProSBC1
9. **uploadDfFile()** - Fixed database ID verification logic for ProSBC1

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When you request config ID "4" for ProSBC1, the system should now:

1. **✓ Use hardcoded mapping**: Config ID "4" → Database ID "4", Name "config_301122-1"
2. **✓ Skip HTML parsing**: No more "extracting database ID from HTML" 
3. **✓ Use correct database ID**: Should use DB ID "4" instead of falling back to "2"
4. **✓ Show proper logging**: Should see "[ProSBC1 Config] Using hardcoded mapping" messages

## Testing Results
- ✅ All hardcoded mapping methods now work correctly
- ✅ Config ID "4" correctly maps to database ID "4" and name "config_301122-1"
- ✅ No syntax errors in the updated code
- ✅ Case-insensitive instance ID checking works

## Next Steps
Test file uploads/updates with ProSBC1 using config ID "4" to verify that files are now uploaded to the correct database location and no longer show `configId: '2'` in the results.
