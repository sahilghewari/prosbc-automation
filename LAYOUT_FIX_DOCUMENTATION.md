/**
 * Layout Fix Documentation
 * 
 * Problem: The website had excessive blank space on the right side for all sections
 * selected from the sidebar, making the layout look unbalanced on larger screens.
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * - The main content area was stretching to fill the entire remaining screen width
 * - No maximum width constraints were applied to the main container
 * - Content was not properly centered for larger screen sizes
 * 
 * Solution Implemented:
 * 
 * 1. Updated App.jsx:
 *    - Added content-container class with responsive max-width
 *    - Applied proper padding and margin for different screen sizes
 *    - Ensured content is centered within the available space
 * 
 * 2. Updated App.css:
 *    - Added .main-content and .content-container classes
 *    - Set max-width: 1400px for normal screens
 *    - Increased to 1600px for 1920px+ screens
 *    - Increased to 2000px for 2560px+ screens
 *    - Added mobile and tablet responsive breakpoints
 * 
 * 3. Responsive Design:
 *    - Mobile (≤768px): Full width with reduced padding
 *    - Tablet (≤1024px): Adjusted padding and full width
 *    - Desktop: Centered with max-width constraints
 *    - Large screens: Increased max-width to prevent cramped layout
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Content is properly centered and doesn't stretch too wide
 * - Consistent spacing across all sections
 * - Better visual balance on all screen sizes
 * - No excessive white space on larger monitors
